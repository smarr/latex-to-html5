LaTeX to HTML5
==============

This repository contains configuration files for tex4ht and post processing
scripts to customize and simplify the HTML generated by tex4ht. Instead of
preserving the full generality of Latex, it seems to be a better approach for
the Web to concentrate on the semantic elements and provide a suitable CSS file.


### Requirements

 - tex4ht aka htlatex
 - tidy, see https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5
 - Python

### Usage

```
$ ht-latex tex-file output-dir
```

The output file is going to be `tex-file-final.html`.

### Status and Contributions

The current status of this project is: *highly experimental and optimized for
myself*, ah, and of course, it works on my machine... 

Pull requests to improve the situation are very welcome.

### Tests

There are a couple of basic tests in `tests`, which can be executed with
`run-tests.py`.
